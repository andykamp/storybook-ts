# Styling and themes #
 
- followed this [Text](https://davidyeiser.com/tutorials/storybook-react-with-dark-mode) to get dark/light mode
- use [geist](https://geist-ui.dev/) as theme and inspiration

- to style the storybook in additoin to the limited exposed dark/light theme, we can override stuff in the .storybook/manager-head.html. But here it is important to remember that it will not respect the dark/light theme :( 
- we can decorate each story with a **decorator** from ./src/decorators. This will add a nice border container to contain the componant and center it properly with correct colors
