# Testing


Storybook provides a clean-room environment for testing components in isolation.


## Spot checking
The simplest testing method is manual “spot checking”. You run Storybook locally, then eyeball every story to verify its appearance and behavior. Publish your Storybook online to share reproductions and get teammates involved.

## Tests runner (https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-tests/test-runner) 

Storybook test runner turns all of your stories into executable tests. It is powered by Jest and Playwright.

For those without a play function: it verifies whether the story renders without any errors.
For those with a play function: it also checks for errors in the play function and that all assertions passed.
These tests run in a live browser and can be executed via the command line or your CI server.

Run test by `yarn run test-storybook` and it should look something like this:

This should show all test for rendering stories, interaction stories, and also snapshot tests if we have some

For setup with CI we can run the test suites before mergin like below  (see [link](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-tests/test-runner) for more)

```js
# .github/workflows/storybook-tests.yml

name: 'Storybook Tests'
on: push
jobs:
  test:
    timeout-minutes: 60
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14.x'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: yarn
      - name: Install Playwright
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps
      - name: Build Storybook
        run: yarn build-storybook --quiet
      - name: Serve Storybook and run tests
        run: |
          npx concurrently -k -s first -n "SB,TEST" -c "magenta,blue" \
            "npx http-server storybook-static --port 6006 --silent" \
            "npx wait-on tcp:6006 && yarn test-storybook"

```

## Visual tests


Visual tests, also called visual regression tests, catch bugs in UI appearance. They work by taking screenshots of every story and comparing them commit-to-commit to identify changes.

Ideal for verifying what the user sees: layout, color, size, and contrast. Storybook is a fantastic tool for visual testing because every story is essentially a test specification. Any time you write or update a story, you get a spec for free.

We use **chromatic** for this in storybook.


## Accessibility tests

Accessibility is the practice of making websites inclusive to all. That means supporting requirements such as: keyboard navigation, screen reader support, touch-friendly, usable color contrast, reduced motion, and zoom support.

Accessibility tests audit the rendered DOM against a set of heuristics based on [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) rules and other industry-accepted best practices. They act as the first line of QA to catch blatant accessibility violations.


You find the accisibility tests in realtime at the addon panel like the image below:

# Interactive play tests

```js
Default.play = async ({ canvasElement }) => {
  const canvas = within(canvasElement);
  // find the element
  const loginButton = await canvas.getByRole("button", { name: /Action/i });
  // perform an action on it (in this case a click)
  await userEvent.click(loginButton);
  // 👇 Assert DOM structure with jest's expect
  // await expect(canvas.getByText(/Welcome/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
};

```
