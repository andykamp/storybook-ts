# Testing


Storybook provides a clean-room environment for testing components in isolation.


## Spot checking
The simplest testing method is manual “spot checking”. You run Storybook locally, then eyeball every story to verify its appearance and behavior. Publish your Storybook online to share reproductions and get teammates involved.

## Tests runner (https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-tests/test-runner) 

Storybook test runner turns all of your stories into executable tests. It is powered by Jest and Playwright.

For those without a play function: it verifies whether the story renders without any errors.
For those with a play function: it also checks for errors in the play function and that all assertions passed.
These tests run in a live browser and can be executed via the command line or your CI server.

Run test by `yarn run test-storybook` and it should look something like this:

For setup with CI see [link](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-tests/test-runner)

## Visual tests


Visual tests, also called visual regression tests, catch bugs in UI appearance. They work by taking screenshots of every story and comparing them commit-to-commit to identify changes.

Ideal for verifying what the user sees: layout, color, size, and contrast. Storybook is a fantastic tool for visual testing because every story is essentially a test specification. Any time you write or update a story, you get a spec for free.

We use **chromatic** for this in storybook.
